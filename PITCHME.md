### Who am I?
I am a web developer, Drupal 8 contributor, BBQ Sauce maker, duck hunter, and computer scientist.

---

### What Do I Accomplish?

At E.C. Barton & Co. I have been an integral part of pushing the envelope to gain more and more customers via digital means, effectively and efficiently.

---

### Who Are My Teammates?

Tom Dowd, H.R. McDonough, Michael Howard, Christie Miller, and Brandon Barnhill

---

### What Do They Do?

---

### Tom

Tom has been the voice of our team for as long as I have been here. He has taken what would normally be considered "The Marketing Swirl" and relays this information in a way that other departments and executives can understand.

---

### H.R.

H.R. Is the critical thinker of our bunch. His ability to mitigate risk and assist in decision making is a priceless asset to us all.

---

### Michael

Grows and maintains one of the best email campaigns in corporate America. He constantly beats expectations and stays well above industry standard metrics.

---

### Christie

Christie is a voice of reason and has already proven to be our best candidate for keeping a feel for the pulse of our customers. She brings insight into our group that we might overlook and brings fresh ideas to us on demand.

---

### Brandon

Brandon is a workhorse when it comes to development of software and systems. He has overcome expectations both with skill and tact as a member of our team. His troubleshooting skills have shaved valuable time off of our development timetable.

---

### Digital Presence

We focus heavily on inbound marketing to reduce wasteful advertisement spending and get more interaction out of our customers.

### Inbound Marketing

Inbound marketing is focused on attracting customers through relevant and helpful content and adding value at every stage in your customer's buying journey. With inbound marketing, potential customers find you through channels like blogs, search engines, and social media.

---

Unlike outbound marketing, inbound marketing does not need to fight for potential customers attention. By creating content designed to address the problems and needs of your ideal customers, you attract qualified prospects and build trust and credibility for your business.

### <span class="gold">Us vs. Them</span>

"I‚Äôd like for you to explore state of the art functions. Scanning our UPC codes, typing in measurements and cost/savings appear. Look at Cliqstudios. You can actually build your own cabinets."

---

### Floor and Decor / Pros: (Cont'd)
- Figures Bill of Materials based on unit of measure.
- Allows customers to keep up with their favorite products and projects. (wishlist)
- Offers same store pickup.
- Offers store to store delivery, then pickup.
- Offers home delivery.

---

### Floor and Decor / Cons:
- Design colors are a harsh contrast.

- Scores a **15/30** on SEO portion of Hubspot Page Grader.

---

---

### Floor and Decor / Cons: (Cont'd)
- Shipping costs for home delivery are cost prohibitive. (Up to 4x more than the subtotal of products.)
- Shipping costs for store to store pickup are cost prohibitive. (Up to 2x more than the subtotal of products.)

---

### Cabinets To Go / Pros:

---

- Shopping experience is severely limited and confusing.

---

---

### Cabinets To Go / Cons: (Cont'd)

- Website design has been polluted and heavily skewed over time.
- Very inconsistent design language.
- No product search.
- Website phoned in from a third party provider and doesn't look maintained.


---

### Cliqstudios / Pros:
- Clean design.
- Design language is consistent.
- Cabinets are delivered to the home for free. (Likely absorbed into price.)
- Quick Quote feature is simple and has a nice CTA at the end of the process.
- Scores an **87/100** on Hubspot Page Grader.
- Scores a **30/30** on SEO portion of Hubspot Page Grader.

---

### Cliqstudios / Cons:
- Slow website. üê¢
- Shopping cart is only used for samples. (What?!)
- Quote checkout is separate from cart checkout. (No reason for this.)
- You literally can't use the shopping cart to buy cabinet pieces on a cabinet ordering website. You have to use their convoluted cabinet quote software or phone it in even though there's a cart icon in the main navigation. This is very confusing.

---

### Our Current Pros:
- Useful navigation.
- Fast loadtimes.
- Heavy organic traffic acquisition.
- Scores **91/100** on Hubspot Page Grader. üé§üíß
- Scores **30/30** on SEO portion of Hubspot Page Grader.
- Product Search.
- Consistent design language.
- Provides a ton of Inbound Marketing opportunites.

---

### Our Current Cons:
- Design could be cleaner
- Search is bulky and inaccurate at times
- No E-Commerce
- No project management
- No bill of material calculators
- No interactive cabinet quote builder
- Store chooser is sometimes a burden

---

### App Development

None of the above mentioned websites/companies offer native applications for iOS or Android. Cliqstudios does have an interactive cabinet calculator that could be translated into some sort of application feature. Linear feet and area calculators would be something that we could provide online as well as in a dedicated iOS/Android app.

---

### App Development

In addition to that, it is most certainly possible to integrate a SKU/Barcode based scanning feature into an app for product identification within our stores. This would allow customers to put together a list of items and figure a bill of materials based on unit of measure by the price per unit.

---

### Bumps in the Road

None of the above technologies can be built until we have a foundation for future development that allows us to build upon an API that integrates our inventory, pricing, and other vital data from Bistrack into said API.

---

### Bumps in the Road

We currently have only barely scratched the tip of the iceberg and will have several months of discovery, development, and testing ahead of us before we can be completely sure of how we intend to build web and mobile applications on our current data.

---

### Bumps in the Road

Bistrack, to my knowledge, offers no API for their customers. Their web services are limited at best and do not offer the opportunities that we need in order to complete these challenges. We will literally be developing their missing features for ourselves by using techniques made widely available to true web developers.

---

### Bumps in the Road

In other words, they're going to be envious of the development we complete for ourselves.

---

### Bumps in the Road

Within the company, our road blocks outside of software development will deal primarily with physical and accounting operations.

---

Some considerations to consider are:
- Logistics & Returns
- Sales tracking by store
- Tax Laws & Payment processing
- Order Fulfillment & Management
- Customer support

---

### Roadmap and Itinerary
