### Us vs. Them

"I‚Äôd like for you to explore state of the art functions. Scanning our UPC codes, typing in measurements and cost/savings appear. Look at Cliqstudios. You can actually build your own cabinets."

Steve Brimner

---

### Floor and Decor / Pros:
- Aesthetically pleasing design.
- Responsive layout is very good.
- Offers design services in-house.
- Offers installation services in-house.
- E-Commerce Site.

---

### Floor and Decor / Pros: (Cont'd)
- Figures Bill of Materials based on unit of measure.
- Allows customers to keep up with their favorite products and projects. (wishlist)
- Offers same store pickup.
- Offers store to store delivery, then pickup.
- Offers home delivery.

---

### Floor and Decor / Cons:
- Design colors are a harsh contrast.
- Design is dated with the use of photographic tiles and superimposed graphic headings. (Should use machine friendly headings for SEO purposes.)
- Scores a **62/100** on Hubspot Page Grader.
- Scores a **15/30** on SEO portion of Hubspot Page Grader.

---

### Floor and Decor / Cons: (Cont'd)
- Shipping costs for home delivery are cost prohibitive. (Up to 4x more than the subtotal of products.)
- Shipping costs for store to store pickup are cost prohibitive. (Up to 2x more than the subtotal of products.)

---

### Cabinets To Go / Pros:
- Offers limited E-Commerce.
- Shipping for cabinets seems reasonably priced.
- Offers limited home shipping/delivery.
- Scores an **82/100** on Hubspot Page Grader.
- Scores a **25/30** on SEO portion of Hubspot Page Grader.

---

### Cabinets To Go / Cons:

- Flooring department is an iframe of their lame attempt to copy Surplus Warehouse.
- Can't buy flooring online.
- Shopping experience is severely limited and confusing.

---

### Cabinets To Go / Cons: (Cont'd)

- Website design has been polluted and heavily skewed over time.
- Very inconsistent design language.
- No product search.
- Website phoned in from a third party provider and doesn't look maintained.

---

### Cliqstudios / Pros:
- Clean design.
- Design language is consistent.
- Cabinets are delivered to the home for free. (Likely absorbed into price.)
- Quick Quote feature is simple and has a nice CTA at the end of the process.

- Scores a **30/30** on SEO portion of Hubspot Page Grader.

---

### Cliqstudios / Cons:
- Slow website. üê¢
- Shopping cart is only used for samples. (What?!)
- Quote checkout is separate from cart checkout. (No reason for this.)
- You literally can't use the shopping cart to buy cabinet pieces on a cabinet ordering website. You have to use their convoluted cabinet quote software or phone it in even though there's a cart icon in the main navigation. This is very confusing.

---

### Our Current Cons:

- No E-Commerce
- No project management
- No bill of material calculators
- No interactive cabinet quote builder
- Store chooser is sometimes a burden

---

### App Development

None of the above mentioned websites/companies offer native applications for iOS or Android. Cliqstudios does have an interactive cabinet calculator that could be translated into some sort of application feature. Linear feet and area calculators would be something that we could provide online as well as in a dedicated iOS/Android app.

---

In addition to that, it is most certainly possible to integrate a SKU/Barcode based scanning feature into an app for product identification within our stores. This would allow customers to put together a list of items and figure a bill of materials based on unit of measure by the price per unit.

### Bumps in the Road

None of the above technologies can be built until we have a foundation for future development that allows us to build upon an API that integrates our inventory, pricing, and other vital data from Bistrack into said API.

We currently have only barely scratched the tip of the iceberg and will have several months of discovery, development, and testing ahead of us before we can be completely sure of how we intend to build web and mobile applications on our current data.

Bistrack, to my knowledge, offers no API for their customers. Their web services are limited at best and do not offer the opportunities that we need in order to complete these challenges. We will literally be developing their missing features for ourselves by using techniques made widely available to true web developers.

In other words, they're going to be envious of the development we complete for ourselves.

Within the company, our road blocks outside of software development will deal primarily with physical and accounting operations.

Some considerations to consider are:
- Logistics
- Sales tracking by store
- Tax laws
- Payment processing
- Returns
- Order fulfillment
- Customer support
- Online sales management

### Roadmap and Itinerary
